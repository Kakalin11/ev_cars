# Data Cleaning and Analysis Project on Python

In this project I used a ev_cars dataset which I found in kaggle website. 

Here is the link to that dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/geoffnel/evs-one-electric-vehicle-dataset?datasetId=832692&sortBy=voteCount


I cleaned and analyzed the dataset on Python. Also, added some graphs to help me understand the data.
